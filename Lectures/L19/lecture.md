### Tab View Controller 

### Ovreview
A tab bar controller allows you to arrange your app according to distinct modes or sections. For example, the Clock app is divided into five modes: World Clock, Alarm, Bedtime, Stopwatch, and Timer.

### Technical Overview

Tab bar controllers are implemented by the UITabBarController class. They allow a user of to switch between multiple arbitrary view controllers by maintaining an array of UIViewControllers.

They can be used to allow the user to navigate between entirely different parts of your application, or they can be used to display two different views of the same backing data. Tab bar controllers also have the built-in ability to display a "More..." interface when more than 5 tabs are added. They can also let the user customize which tabs are shown by on the main tab bar when there are more than 5 tabs. An example of this behavior is found in the standard iOS "Music" app (previously "iTunes").







### Due and submitted to me by end of class (`rcslatki@syr.edu`):
* [ ] 
* [ ] Create an app that displays distinct types of information about yourself in separate tabs.
