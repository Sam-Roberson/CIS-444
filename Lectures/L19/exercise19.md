## Tab View Controller Assignment

The objective of this assignment is to use a tab bar controller to display different modes of information or operation. You'll create an app that displays distinct types of information about yourself in separate tabs. 

1. Create a new project called "AboutMe" using the Single View Application template, and set the device family to Universal. 

2. As you go through the steps below, remember that this app is—like the name implies—all about you, so make it personal.



### Step 1: Set Up Your View Controllers
* Use custom tab bar images. You can create your own following guidelines [here](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/custom-icons/) or use  [sample image assets](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lh8v8ndrz3dkoh9/AADIq-Xk5SvSYiQicwqX4_3ia?dl=0) 

* Drag at least three view controllers from the Object library. Each view controller will represent a facet of your life. Example: one view controller for bio, one for family, and one for hobbies. But think outside the bounds

* Give each view controller a background color. Or drag an image view to cover the entire view controller and set a background image.

* On each view controller, drag out labels to provide text about yourself, your family, your hobbies, or whatever personal info you've decided to include.

*  Drag out image views and set their images. Be sure to add constraints that will keep your views arranged consistently on different screen sizes and orientations.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Tab Bar Controller

* Select all your view controllers and embed them in a tab bar controller.

* Give each tab a title that fits the personal info you're adding in that section.

* Set the tab icon on each tab. You may use the assets provided or find your own icons.

* Run the app. Check that the tab titles and icons appear.


### Step 3: Submit

* Email your project to `RCSlatki@syr.edu` by March 30, 2020
